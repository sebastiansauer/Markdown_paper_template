# Simple Markdown template for (student's term) papers



## What do I get here?
Here you will find a simple template, so that you can write your term paper, assignment, report, scientific journal paper, with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) but with getting a polished PDF-file spitted out (formatted using [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org)).

See the file `paper.pdf` for an **example**.


## So what's the idea?
1. Write your stuff in a normal text file (ie. [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)).
2. Don't worry all about formatting, layout etc. (well, nearly).
3. Focus on content instead.
3. Use [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) to convert your textfile to PDF (or to DOCX or HTML etc).
4. When you call Pandoc, give the template provided here as an argument.


## How does it help?
- Get beautifully formatted PDF files.
- You do not have to be familiar with [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org).
- Focus on content, don't get distracted with formatting while writing.
- No costs.
- Open source.
- No convuluted texts, no `|{}\\\\\` messing up your text.
- No steep learning curve; while Pandoc is a command line tools, you will find that is are easy to use.
- Allows for transparency in writing your texts.
- Allowd for including R-syntax (eg., with [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr)).
- The software happily reside on Windows, Mac and Linux (I believe).


## What software do I need?
- You need to have [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) installed on your machine; [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) comes with it.
- For PDF-Output you need to have \LaTeX ([Tex](https://www.latex-project.org) installed.
- Any simple text editor will do the job.
- So make sure you have the *software installed before* you use the templates provided here. Click the link for [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org); Markdown comes with it.


## OK, I want to start. Now what?
1. Take the textfile boilerplate `paper.txt`. Write your content in it. Use Pandoc's dialect of Markdown for basic formatting (header, lists, boldface...).
3. Convert `paper.txt` to PDF by calling this file from command line (Terminal): `pandoc.make`, like this in Mac and Linux: `sh ./pandoc.make`. In Windows, delete the first line `#!/bin/sh`; then copy the rest to the command line (Terminal) or to a batch file (`.bat`), and run it.
4. Look at `paper.pdf` to see the results.


## Caveats
- Pandoc should be in your path variable so that you can call it from any folder.
- Make sure you have the latest version of Pandoc.
- Make sure you have the standard set of Latex packages installed (come with standard installation; huge in size).


## Advanced
- Look at the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) header file `header.yml`to tweak some defaults, such as
	- font (size, family...)
	- margins
	- enable, disable TOC, List of figures/tables
	- changes citation style (based on [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)).
- See [Pandoc's excellent user guide for options](http://pandoc.org/README.html).
- Have a look at the TeX template and change it according to your needs, eg., you may wish to adapt the front page according to your needs.
